    "### Q2. Task B: Correlation\n",
    "Statisticians and data analysts usually like to study about correlation between different observed variables. This helps uncover interesting patterns in the data such as causal relationships (e.g., snow on the road leads to increase in number of accidents). Correlation studies are important for multiple reasons:\n",
    "- While [correlation does not imply causation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation), a lack of correlation implies a lack of causation. This can be used to rule out many causal relationships.\n",
    "- Correlation helps with prediction. The more closely related two variables are, the easier it is to predict one from the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we will plot the friends_count (on y-axis) vs the followers_count (on x-axis) using the matplotlib package. [Here](http://matplotlib.org/examples/shapes_and_collections/scatter_demo.html) is an example to get started with scatter plots."

    "### Q2. Task C: Degree distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In graph theory, the degree of a node is the number of connections it has to other nodes. A common statistic to look out for in the case of real world graphs is the degree distribution. Literature says degrees of nodes in real world graphs follow a [power law distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law). The implication is that a scatter plot of num_users versus k (as we will define below) yields an almost straight line. In this task, we shall verify whether the given crawl of Twitter network satisfies this property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us call the number of friends a Twitter user has as his/her degree. The degree distribution is a histogram of the number of friends. Our task is to visualize this histogram. Use the default number of bins."
